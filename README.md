# Wine-Quality-data-set
Domain:Food & Beverages Project 03: Wine Quality data 
 
The data set is related to different attributes of red wine. 
 
Input variables (based on physicochemical tests) 
1 - fixed acidity 2 - volatile acidity 3 - citric acid 4 - residual sugar 5 - chlorides 6 - free sulfur dioxide 7 - total sulfur dioxide 8 - density 9 - pH 10 - sulphates 11 - alcohol 
 
Output variable (based on sensory data) 12 - quality (score between 0 and 10) 
 
Exploration ideas 
 
Data preparation: dividing quality score into 3 different categories, etc. Create visualizations to depict how residual sugar, density and alcohol affect the quality of the wine. Other variable observations. Faulty Wines: Characteristics that can influence wine quality negatively. Univariate and bivariate analysis.
